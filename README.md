## Programming guidelines I follow

- Add **everything** (logs&logics) about the patch to the commit message, in **least** amount of words.
- Use debuggers, git blame, string search, docs, release notes, and experiments to understand the code.
- Read (around) the errors **slowly** and try to fix it myself before asking. **Googling** is always an option.
- Turn on the **verbose switch** or `-vvv` flag to understand what's going on under the hood.
- Build a **mental model** of the problem before approaching the solutions, and rapidly prototype and fail fast.
- **Embrace simplicity**. A long simple solution is much better than a short tricky one (exceptions exist!).
- **Read a lot** of code, **write a lot** of code and push atleast **one patch** a day.
- Review other's patches and always ask others to review your patches, more eyes produce better code.

> Avoid shortcuts and learn to read the docs and manpages, sit down for long,
> uninterrupted hours working towards the goals which you chose for the day, 
> and be a team player and ask for help whenever needed.

## Conversation guidelines I follow

- **Speak slowly**! Thoughts run faster than the tongue, specially for a foreign tongue.
- Don't overthink, **no-one is judging** you for small mistakes as long as you acknowledge and correct them.
- The conversation is **not about you**, infact most of the things are not about you, so **pay attention & listen**.
- Assume that everything is said in **good faith**, unless said otherwise.
- **Don't drag** a conversation, (long and short) pauses are a part of the conversation, **don't feel awkward**.
- **Pass around the baton** to involve everyone around, don't just keep talking on your own, **don't interrupt**.
- **Don't force smile** and don't take **otheres not smiling as disinterest**.
- **It's fine to leave a conversation** politely, if you don't feel like being there.

> Enjoy these moments in life because you would be dead by the end of next
> 60-70-80 years, buried in the soil or burnt to ashes depending on the which
> comics you believe in... and with you will be gone your shallow thoughts,
> incorrect opinions and the boring instagram account.

## Dailylife guidelines I follow

- Sleep at 10pm for 7 hours after a good day's work. Have a **nice alarm ringtone**.
- Reject **cheap/instant** dopamine, think long term.
- **Don't react**, be in the **present** and **pay attention to details** and surroundings. 
- **Avoid rush and shortcuts**, great things don't happen in a day and shortcuts often take longer.
- Learn to get **excited** when things get hard, because doing hard things makes a difference.
- Don't do what **90%** is doing, be it **social-media**, **vibe-coding**, **video-consumption**.
- **Exercise daily**, know that **food is not entertainment** and **entertainment is not a neccessity**.
