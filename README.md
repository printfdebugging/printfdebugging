## Programming guidelines I follow
- Add **everything** (logs&logics) about the patch to the commit message, in **least** amount of words.
- Use debuggers, git blame, string search, docs, release notes, and experiments to understand the code.
- Read (around) the errors **slowly** and try to fix it myself before asking. **Googling** is always an option.
- Turn on the **verbose switch** or `-vvv` flag to understand what's going on under the hood.
- Build a **mental model** of the problem before approaching the solutions.
- Review other's patches!!

> Avoid shortcuts and learn to read the docs and manpages, sit down for long,
> uninterrupted hours working towards the goals which you chose for the day, 
> and be a team player and ask for help whenever needed.

## Conversation guidelines I follow
- **Speak slowly**! Thoughts run faster than the tongue, specially for a foreign tongue.
- Don't overthink, **no-one is judging** you for small mistakes as long as you acknowledge and correct them.
- The conversation is **not about you**, infact most of the things are not about you.
- Assume that everything is said in **good faith**, unless said otherwise.
- **Don't drag** a conversation, (long and short) pauses are a part of the conversation, **don't feel awkward**.
- **Pass around the baton** to involve everyone around, don't just keep talking on your own.
- **It's fine to leave a conversation** politely, if you don't feel like being there.
