## Programming guidelines I follow
- Add **everything** about the patch to the commit message, in **least** amount of words
- Use debuggers, git blame, string search, docs, release notes, and experiments to understand the code.
- Read (around) the errors **slowly** and try to fix it myself before asking. **Googling** is always an option.
- Turn on the **verbose switch** or `-vvv` flag to understand what's going on under the hood.
- Build a **mental model** of the problem before approaching the solutions.

<!-- also check release notes -->
<!---->
<!-- mental model of the code comes first, refactors/fixes follow -->
<!-- start reviewing others patches -->
<!---->
<!-- to correct language, listen to yourself speaking -->

<!-- create an 8 bit computer on your own -->
<!-- first scope out the existing codebase before wirtiing something of hyour own -->
